# Shift Relay

A small React Native app for handing work from one field shift to the next. It is built with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, and its own design system.

The default fictional demo runs without a backend or API keys. Optional shared mode adds a Python service with durable SQLite storage, private account tokens, assigned tasks, report building, and daily email schedules. Web and iOS (Expo Go) are supported. See [shared setup](docs/shared-setup.md).

#update 1.1

-adding shared DB for persistent data

-task assignment 

-report builder and delivery automation



## What it shows

| Area | How |
|------|-----|
| React Native + TypeScript | Expo, strict TypeScript, no `any` |
| Code quality | Feature folders, typed hooks, explicit loading / empty / error states, lint rules that enforce the design system |
| Redux | Redux Toolkit for UI state, RTK Query for data |
| Design system | An original palette as W3C DTCG tokens → Style Dictionary → typed React Native theme + CSS, light/dark, contrast checked at build time |
| AI in development | Specs first, Claude Code skills and rules in the repo, a verify gate on every change, and an honest log in [AI.md](AI.md) |

## Built with AI

This app was built with a combination of **Cursor**, **Claude** (Opus and Sonnet), and **Codex** (Sol). What keeps that work reviewable rather than magic:

- **Rules in the repo.** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the one rule file every tool reads (strict types, tokens only, typed hooks, states on every screen); [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) imports it.
- **Spec before code.** Components and features start as a spec in [docs/specs/](docs/specs/).
- **A gate, not trust.** Typecheck, lint, format, a contrast check on the palette, and Playwright E2E run against AI output the same way they run against hand-written code.
- **An honest log.** [AI.md](AI.md) records what AI did, what had to be corrected, and where it was wrong, including the mistakes the gate caught.

## Screens

1. **Sign in**: three one-tap demo accounts: Jordan Lee (Morning Shift Manager), Avery Smith (Night Shift Manager), and Elena Ruiz (Operations Manager)
2. **Dashboard**: today's Daily Sheet (Morning → Midday handoff → Night), the account's next action, and open high-priority issues. For Elena, this week's handoff and issue numbers sit above the Daily Sheet and the full open-issue list below it
3. **Shift sheet** (a modal over Dashboard or Logs): Shift Photos at the top (take or choose, review, save) with a camera bar pinned to the bottom, one required restock check, issues, note, and sign-off
4. **Logs**: today and 21 complete operational days, grouped by date, with search and sorting
5. **Issues**: flag, resolve, and filter high-priority issues
6. **Shift Photos** (every account): each day's saved photos, newest first, split into Morning, Midday, and Night, with a placeholder only where today's shifts have none yet (every finished shift has one or two fictional drawings, including a mouse on duty); tap one to view it full size, or open the sheet it came from. Only Elena can delete a saved photo
7. **Design system**: light/dark themes, every component, and the simulated-failure control

Everyone who signs, checks, raises, resolves, or photographs something shows as initials beside it.

## Walkthrough

A suggested path through the app:

1. Sign in as **Jordan**. On the Dashboard, tap **Complete Morning**.
2. Take a photo, either way. The center **camera** tab on a phone always asks which shift the photo is for (Jordan has Morning and Midday open), opens the camera, and saves the photo straight to that shift, then confirms and stays where you were. Or use **Take photo** / **Library** in the bar pinned to the bottom of a shift sheet (camera on iPhone, file picker on web); those photos wait in the sheet to review, remove any you don't want, and **Save**. Signing off is blocked while sheet photos are unsaved; once saved, Jordan can't delete them.
3. Tick the restock check and sign off. Open the Midday handoff, flag an issue, and send it.
4. Switch to **Avery**. Review the open issue, receive the handoff, and complete Night.
5. Switch to **Elena**. Her Dashboard shows this week's numbers and every open issue. **Shift Photos** shows today's Morning photo; tap it to preview, and delete it if it shouldn't be on the record. She can also add photos to any of the day's open shifts (the camera tab asks which one), but she cannot sign or raise anything.

## Data and photos

In demo mode, a mock RTK Query API serves generated, fictional data from memory, so every device has its own copy and a restart restores the seed. Shift photos are held the same way: the image stays on the device, and the log stores its local URI. Historical shift photos are fictional drawings generated in this repo; no real place is shown.

## Shared operations

- **Shared database:** shifts, issues, photos, tasks, reports, schedules, and delivery history persist across devices and restarts.
- **Tasks:** assign work, set priority/due dates, track status, and record completion notes. Link a shift issue to a task.
- **Report builder:** preview and save outstanding work and overnight changes; download HTML or CSV on web.
- **Automated delivery:** configure one daily schedule with recipients, local time, and timezone; server SMTP sends the report and records delivery status.

Setup and limitations: [docs/shared-setup.md](docs/shared-setup.md). No report import is included.

## Running it

**Stack:** Expo SDK 57 · React Native 0.86 · React 19.2 · TypeScript 6 (strict) · Expo Router.

**Targets:** web and iOS ([ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-web-and-ios-targets-playwright-e2e.md)).

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+, and [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on an iPhone. Setup: [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

**Camera:** `expo-image-picker`, which runs in Expo Go. iOS asks for camera access the first time. A desktop browser has no camera, so it shows "Upload photos" and opens a file picker; those photos are tagged "Uploaded", while camera photos from a phone or the iPhone app are not. On a phone browser, camera capture needs HTTPS or `localhost`.

### Quick start

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # once: the browser for E2E
npm run doctor:env       # checks Node and Playwright
npm run web              # develop in the browser
npm start                # scan the QR code with the iPhone to open it in Expo Go
```

### Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `start` / `start:clear` | Expo dev server (`:clear` resets the Metro cache) |
| `web` | Dev server, opened in the browser |
| `start:tunnel` | Dev server over a tunnel, when the iPhone is not on the same Wi-Fi |
| `ios` | Dev server for an iOS Simulator on macOS; this project is checked on a real iPhone through Expo Go |
| `typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, strict |
| `lint` / `lint:fix` | ESLint (Expo config + Prettier) |
| `format` / `format:check` | Prettier write / check |
| `check` | typecheck + lint + format check, the local quality gate |
| `e2e` / `e2e:smoke` / `e2e:ui` | All Playwright specs / just the smoke spec / the Playwright UI |
| `doctor` | `expo-doctor`: dependency and config health |
| `npx expo export --platform web` | Production web build into `dist/` |
| `doctor:env` | Machine setup check (Node, Playwright, Chromium) |
| `tokens` / `tokens:self-test` | Build tokens and check contrast / prove the contrast check fails on a bad color |
