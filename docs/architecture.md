# Architecture

> This document describes the original demo unless stated otherwise. Optional shared operations (durable storage, tasks, report builder, and scheduled SMTP delivery) are described in [shared setup](shared-setup.md), [the feature spec](specs/shared-operations.md), and [ADR 0010](decisions/0010-shared-python-service.md).

```

Routes live in `src/app/`; `@/*` maps to `src/*`. The intended dependency direction is app → features → design system. The design system receives theme values through its provider and does not import feature data.

## State and data flow

| Kind | Owner | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mock server data | RTK Query and `logsApi` | Logs, issues, mutations |
| UI state | Redux slices | Demo account, theme, issue filter, unsaved shift-photo drafts |
| Development controls | `devSlice` | Simulated failure; mock latency (fixed) |
| Short form state | Component state | Note, raise-issue draft, selected modal log |

The mock base query serves fictional logs and issues from memory, with optional simulated latency or failure. Mutations update that source and RTK Query caches. A restart restores today's pending logs and 21 completed historical days. Screens derive Daily Sheet status, open issues, and manager metrics from query data rather than copying results into slices. Saved shift photos are local URIs; seeded historical images are generated drawings.

## Theming

Style Dictionary builds typed theme tokens and CSS from `tokens/`. The contrast script validates the palette. `uiSlice` stores the color scheme; `AppThemeProvider` resolves it and exposes the theme through `useTheme()`. Components use `makeStyles()` with token values. Generated token files are not edited by hand.

## Navigation and errors

Expo Router provides typed routes. `AppShell` uses headless tabs with wide side navigation and narrow bottom tabs; a drawer gives narrow screens access to all sections. The center bottom-tab button is a camera (`ShiftCaptureButton`), not a route: it asks which of the signed-in Shift Manager's open forms the photo is for, opens the camera, and saves the photo straight to that form, then confirms and stays on the current screen. Each section has a shared themed stack header. Sign-in gates the shell. The log detail is a shared modal over Dashboard, Logs, or Issues, so closing it returns to the originating section.

Queries show loading, error with Retry, and stale-data warnings where data is cached. Failed mutations keep the relevant draft visible. A root render error boundary catches render errors.

`npm run typecheck` first runs `scripts/typed-routes.mjs` to regenerate `.expo/types/router.d.ts` from `src/app`. The installed Expo route watcher can include unrelated files on Windows because it checks for `../` while Windows paths use `..\\`.
