# Data model

> This document describes the original demo unless stated otherwise. Optional shared operations (durable storage, tasks, report builder, and scheduled SMTP delivery) are described in [shared setup](shared-setup.md), [the feature spec](specs/shared-operations.md), and [ADR 0010](decisions/0010-shared-python-service.md).


The app uses fictional Shift Managers, operational logs, and high-priority issues. Nothing in the public repository identifies a real employee, customer, facility, or work order.

## Types

```ts
export type ShiftPhase = 'morning' | 'midday' | 'night';
export type LogStatus = 'pending' | 'awaitingSecondSignOff' | 'signedOff';

export interface LogConfirmation {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  confirmed: boolean;
}

export interface LogSignOff {
  actor: string;
  at: string; // ISO timestamp
}

/** One flip of a required check. */
export interface CheckEvent {
  checkId: string;
  label: string;
  checked: boolean;
  actor: string;
  at: string;
}

export interface ShiftLog {
  id: string; // "LOG-2026-09-23-morning"
  operationalDate: string; // local YYYY-MM-DD
  phase: ShiftPhase;
  status: LogStatus;
  confirmations: LogConfirmation[]; // exactly one
  note: string | null;
  signOffs: LogSignOff[];
  checkEvents: CheckEvent[]; // oldest first
  issueReview: { issueIds: string[]; actor: string; at: string } | null; // Midday receipt
  walkPhotos: WalkPhoto[]; // oldest first
}

export interface WalkPhoto {
  id: string;
  uri: string; // local file URI on iOS; data or blob URI on web
  caption: string | null;
  source: 'camera' | 'upload'; // see "Photo source" below
  actor: string;
  at: string;
}

export type IssueCategory = 'safety' | 'equipment' | 'security' | 'temperature' | 'other';
export type IssueStatus = 'open' | 'resolved';

export interface IssueEvent {
  type: 'raised' | 'resolved' | 'photoAdded';
  actor: string;
  at: string;
}

export interface IssuePhoto {
  id: string;
  uri: string;
  purpose: 'evidence' | 'resolution';
  source: 'camera' | 'upload';
  takenBy: string;
  takenAt: string;
}

export interface Issue {
  id: string; // "ISS-001"
  category: IssueCategory;
  details: string; // optional context for a preset; the description for "other"
  sourceLogId: string; // every issue belongs to one log
  photos: IssuePhoto[]; // oldest first
  status: IssueStatus;
  raisedBy: string;
  raisedAt: string;
  resolvedBy: string | null;
  resolvedAt: string | null;
  events: IssueEvent[]; // oldest first
}
```

Issue types live in `src/features/issues/types.ts`; log types in `src/features/logs/types.ts`.

`RaiseIssueInput.sourceLogId` is `string | null`: from the Issues tab it is `null` and the mock API links today's active log. `RaiseIssueInput` and `ResolveIssueInput` also take optional `photos: { uri, source }[]`, and `AddWalkPhotosInput` takes `photos` the same way.

**Invariants:**

- Each operational date has exactly one log for each phase.
- Each log has exactly one phase-specific confirmation, about restock.
- Checks toggle only on today's pending log, by the Shift Manager whose turn it is. Every toggle appends a `CheckEvent`.
- Sign-off requires the confirmation to be set on the stored log.
- A signed Morning or Night log has all confirmations set and one sign-off.
- A Midday log with the Morning Shift Manager's sign-off has `awaitingSecondSignOff`.
- A signed Midday log has all confirmations set, followed by the Night Shift Manager's receipt sign-off.
- Night can't receive the handoff while issues are open without acknowledging all of them ("Open issues reviewed (N)"). The acknowledgement is stored as `issueReview` and appended as a `CheckEvent`.
- Shift Managers raise and resolve issues; the Operations Manager observes them.
- A log has any number of issues. An `other` issue has non-empty `details`.
- A resolved issue has resolver, resolution timestamp, and a `resolved` event.
- Resolving an issue never mutates or deletes its source log.

**Derived, never stored:** today's phase progress, open issue count (nav badge and Dashboard), history groups, and age labels.

The UI also derives a `DailySheetSummary` for each operational date from its three `ShiftLog` records. It contains the ordered phase records, overall `notStarted | inProgress | complete` status, and the active account's next action. It is never persisted or copied into Redux.

Issue photos are built ([issue-photos.md](specs/issue-photos.md)): `Issue.photos` holds evidence and resolution photos, and each photo adds a `photoAdded` event stamped with the same time as the raise or resolve it came with. The UI shows the raise or resolve as one trail line (the person's initials and the time; the full name is the accessible label). The photos show as thumbnails, with no count in the line.

**Shift Photos** are built. Every `ShiftLog` has `walkPhotos: WalkPhoto[]` (`id`, `uri`, `caption`, `source`, `actor`, `at`), oldest first. A Shift Manager takes photos, reviews them as drafts, and saves them; drafts are UI state in `walkDraftsSlice` (per log, never sent to the API), and sign-off is refused while any remain. `addWalkPhotos(input)` saves drafts to today's form that is not signed off, from the Shift Manager who owns that phase (Jordan adds to Morning and Midday, Avery to Midday and Night) or from the Operations Manager, who can add to any of the day's open forms. It does not have to be their turn to sign. Signed-off forms are closed to everyone. `removeWalkPhoto(input)` is Operations Manager only, on any date: saved photos are the record. The URI points at the image on the device (a data or blob URI on web), and nothing is uploaded. Every signed-off historical shift has one or two fictional drawings from `scripts/build-seed-photos.mjs`, including a mouse on duty. Only today's pending shifts start with none.

## Photo source

Every shift photo and issue photo records where it came from. `camera` means a camera took it: a native build, or a touch-first browser (a phone or tablet). `upload` means it came from a file or the photo library, which includes the desktop browser's file picker and any photo picked from an iPhone's library. The device decides (`features/camera/captureSupport.ts`), so a desktop browser shows "Upload photos" instead of "Take photo" and never claims a camera. Uploads are allowed but tagged "Uploaded" wherever the photo is shown. Seed photos are `camera`. A real backend would also strip location metadata from uploads and compare the file's own timestamp with the shift.

## Seed dataset

- Generate the previous 21 local calendar days at mock initialization.
- Each historical day has Morning, Midday, and Night signed off: 63 logs, each with a check history.
- Those 63 logs render as 21 complete Daily Sheets and move with the device-local calendar at initialization.
- Generate today's three logs as pending so the walkthrough can start with any phase.
- Link six issues to historical logs: four resolved and two open.
- Use deterministic templates and fictional Shift Managers so tests remain stable.
- Restarting the app restores the generated seed state.

## Mock API

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `getShiftLogs` | `ShiftLog[]` for today and the seeded history |
| `getShiftLog(id)` | `ShiftLog`, or a 404-shaped error |
| `toggleLogCheck(input)` | Updated `ShiftLog` with the new `CheckEvent`; optimistic in the cache |
| `signOffShiftLog(input)` | Updated `ShiftLog`; Midday advances through two approvals, the second requiring `reviewedIssueIds` to cover every open issue |
| `getIssues` | `Issue[]` |
| `raiseIssue(input)` | New open `Issue` |
| `resolveIssue(input)` | Resolved `Issue` with resolver and timestamp |
| `addWalkPhotos(input)` | Updated `ShiftLog` with saved shift photos |
| `removeWalkPhoto(input)` | Updated `ShiftLog` after an Operations Manager deletes a saved photo |

The mock base query reads latency and simulated-failure controls from Redux. Mutations update the in-memory mock source and RTK Query cache.
