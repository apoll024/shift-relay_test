# Testing

> This document describes the original demo unless stated otherwise. Optional shared operations (durable storage, tasks, report builder, and scheduled SMTP delivery) are described in [shared setup](shared-setup.md), [the feature spec](specs/shared-operations.md), and [ADR 0010](decisions/0010-shared-python-service.md).


## Strategy

| When | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **Every change** | `typecheck`, `lint`, Playwright E2E on the web build, and a manual check on the iPhone | Test what the user sees from the start. Catch "it compiles but doesn't launch" early |
| **Planned** | Jest + React Native Testing Library unit tests | Added once components and slices are stable, so tests aren't rewritten every time the design moves |

E2E comes first because it tests what the user sees; unit tests follow once the parts stop churning.

## E2E (Playwright, web)

Flows, all kept green:

| Flow | Checks |
|------|--------|
| `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` | App loads; the top-level screens render after sign-in |
| `e2e/theme.spec.ts` | Dark toggle changes the background |
| `e2e/design-system.spec.ts` | Every component `testID` is visible |
| `e2e/logging.spec.ts` | Sign in → choose shift → sign off with issue → complete issue; verify 21-day history |
| `e2e/sign-in.spec.ts`, `e2e/issues.spec.ts`, `e2e/walk-photos.spec.ts` | Demo sign-in (every sign-in lands on the Dashboard), issue lifecycle and trail, Shift Photos, and both camera paths: the center camera tab and the sheet's pinned bar |
| `e2e/shell.spec.ts`, `e2e/initials.spec.ts`, `e2e/manager-dashboard.spec.ts` | Responsive shell, initials attribution, and the manager Dashboard |
| `e2e/errors.spec.ts` | Simulated failure → raise-issue error shown, form kept, nothing added |

`npm run e2e` runs `playwright test`. It starts `expo start --web` on its own port, 8181 (so a dev server for another project on the default 8081 is never picked up), or reuses this repo's server if one is already on 8181. Every spec runs twice: a desktop Chrome viewport and a phone viewport. A few skip on the viewport they do not apply to (for example, bottom-tab tests skip on desktop). Specs find elements with `getByTestId`, because React Native Web renders `testID` as `data-testid` (see [design-system.md](design-system.md#components) rule 6). If something else is already serving port 8181, Playwright reuses it and tests that app instead, so stop it first. `npm run e2e:ui` opens the Playwright UI for debugging. First-time setup: `npx playwright install chromium`.

**What web E2E misses:** native-only behavior (shadows, `Pressable` feedback, safe areas, font metrics). The iPhone check below covers the main flows. See [ADR 0007](decisions/0007-web-and-ios-targets-playwright-e2e.md).

### iPhone check (manual)

`npm start`, then scan the QR code with the iPhone camera to open Expo Go (same Wi-Fi; otherwise `npm run start:tunnel`).

- [ ] App launches without a red screen
- [ ] The changed flow done by hand, result noted with the date

Report it as **manual ✓ (date)** or **not done**, never as an automated pass.

## Unit tests (planned)

| Target | Cases |
|--------|-------|
| Log selectors / grouping | today phases, 21-day history, and open priority issues |
| `uiSlice` | set the color scheme |
| `mockBaseQuery` | query success; log sign-off and issue completion; `simulateFailure` returns an error; unknown id returns 404 |
| Contrast script | fails on a too-light color, passes on the real palette |
| Theme | light and dark have every `ColorTokens` key |
| `Button` | renders label; `onPress` fires; not fired when disabled or loading |
| `Badge` | `max` overflow shows `{max}+` |

## `/verify`

Runs, in order: `typecheck` → `lint` → `format:check` → `e2e` → `test` (once set up), then records the iPhone check. Reports each as **pass**, **fail**, or **skipped (reason)**. A gate passes only when every required check passes.
